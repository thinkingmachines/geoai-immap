# Detection of Rapidly Growing Informal Settlements 

This repository accompanies our research work for Informal Settlement Detection in Northern Colombia.

The goal of this project is to provide a means for faster, cheaper, and more scalable detection of rapidly growing informal settlements using low-resolution satellite images and machine learning.

## Setup
1. [Install miniconda](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#install_miniconda)
1. [Create conda environment named ee](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#install_api)
1. [Create conda environment named gdal_env then install gdal inside](https://gdal.org/download.html#conda)
1. Install conda environment named repo_env from environment.yml

Notable dependencies include:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Anaconda3-2019.10
- earthengine-api==0.1.223
- gdal==3.1.0
- scikit-learn=0.21.3

## Usage
```
python run.py --area=’riohacha’ --start 2021 --end 2021
```
where
* area = municipality in [these names](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/geoai-immap/blob/master/utils/gee_settings.py#L4)
* start = year to start collecting satellite images for rollout, exact date will be made Jan 1, {year}
* end = year to end collecting satellite images for rollout, exact date will be made Dec 31, {year}

`run.py` consists of 3 scripts that accept area as a parameter:
* download.py - acquires Sentinel2 images from Google Earth Engine
* preprocess.py - deflates downloaded images and calculates indices
* predict.py - generates settlement probability map


## Code Organization
This repository is divided into three main parts:

- **data/**: contains the informal settlement datasets; also the destination for downloaded satellite imagery
- **notebooks/**: contains all Jupyter notebooks for data processing and model experimentation
- **utils/**: contains utility scripts for geospatial data pre-processing and modeling

We evaluated model performance across different negative sampling parameters, and that is reflected on 10K, 30K, 50K, in the 3 instances of 03_Model_Optimization.ipynb

## Data
For privacy concerns, we did not include in this repo the labelled training data that identified informal settlements in Colombia. If you need this dataset, please contact [iMMAP Colombia](https://immap.org/colombia/) or [3iSolution Colombia](https://3is.org/colombia/) at info@immap.org, info@3is.org.

To use your own data, please:
1. Save informal settlement polygon as GeoPackage "area_mask.gpkg"
1. Save admin boundary for department/municipality as GeoPackage "area.gpkg"
2. Download satellite images using notebooks/00_Data_Download, (instructions how, inside)
3. Process the images using notebooks/01_Data_Preprocessing.

Resulting files and their directories should look like the following:
```
├── data
│   ├── pos_masks
│       ├── {area}_mask.gpkg
│   ├── admin_bounds
│       ├── {area}.gpkg
│   ├── images <derived>
│       ├── {area}_2015-2016.tif
│       ├── {area}_2017-2018.tif
│       ├── {area}_2019-2020.tif
│   ├── indices <derived>
│       ├── indices_{area}_2015-2016.tif
│       ├── indices_{area}_2017-2018.tif
│       ├── indices_{area}_2019-2020.tif
```

where area is the name of the area you're evaluating for as one word, e.g. Villa del Rosario -> villadelrosario.
